# Dog_Breed_Identifier

## Overview
This project aims to classify dog breeds using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains a collection of images, each labeled with the corresponding dog breed. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify the breed of a dog from an input image.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two main components:

Train Images: A collection of labeled dog images used for training and developing the machine learning model.

Test Images: A separate set of dog images used to evaluate the model's performance and generate predictions.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data Preprocessing: The training dataset is preprocessed, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, to prepare it for model training.

Model Development: Various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are trained on the preprocessed data to predict dog breeds.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using the test dataset, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated.

Deployment: The trained model is deployed as a Streamlit web application, allowing users to upload images and get predictions for dog breeds.
